##1)What is the distinction between a list and an array?
List
1)Contains elements of different data types
2)Explicitly importing module is not required to declare a list
3)Cannot handle arithmetic operations
4)Can be nested inside another list
5)Mostly used in the shorter sequence of data elements

Array
1)Contains elements of same data types
2)Need to import the module explicitly to declare an array
3)Can handle arithmetic operations
4)Must contain all elements of the same size
5)Mostly used in the longer sequence of data elements


2)What are the qualities of a binary tree?
1. The number of external nodes is 1 more than the number of internal nodes
2.  The number of external nodes is at least h + 1, where h is the height of the tree, and at most 2h . 
3.  The number of internal nodes is at least h and at most 2h - 1.
4.  The total number of nodes in a binary tree is at least 2*h + 1 and at most  2h+1 - 1.
5.  The height, h, of a binary tree with n nodes is at least log n+1  and at most n.
6.  A binary tree with n nodes has exactly n - 1 edges.
